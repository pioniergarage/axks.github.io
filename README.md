# Website for our startup tour to Shanghai in 2016
This README is an excerpt of the actual homepage available at (shanghai.pioniergarage.de)[http://shanghai.pioniergarage.de].

15 students from PionierGarage, the university group for entrepreneurship at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, are going to visit one of the world's most significant tech and startup regions: Shanghai.

The Pioneers are heading to China! After inspiring tours to the Silicon Valley, Boston and New York, London, Tel Aviv, Berlin and Munich the PionierGarage is visiting Shanghai. In 2016 we are curious and excited to visit a start-up region in China. We are full of energy to find out about the entrepreneurial scene in Shanghai and to get in touch with a variety of interesting and inspiring people. During the 10-day tour, we are visiting a number of startups, venture capitalists, entrepreneurial organisations, and educational institutions.

Be sure to check out the amazing tour video we made on our Silicon Valley Tour 2013:
